Industriart
-----------
Industriart is a simple client for the JFrog Artifactories REST API. It currently
only supports few basic methods but patches are certainly welcome.

Run the example like:

    PYTHONPATH=. python examples/refresh-yum-repo.py -a http://localhost:8081/artifactory -u admin -p password repo1 repo2
